# Optimize Jump Command Implementation for Memory Efficiency

> Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-level Tasks, and generate the code that will satisfy Objectives

## Objectives
- Optimize the existing `/jump` command implementation to be more memory-efficient
- Replace full message copies with message indices to reduce memory usage
- Maintain the same functionality and user experience
- Ensure the completer still shows helpful message previews

## Contexts
- modules/chat/interactive.py: Contains the InteractiveChat class with the current jump implementation
- modules/chat/completers.py: Contains the JumpCompleter class

## Low-level Tasks
1. UPDATE modules/chat/interactive.py:
   - Modify the ConversationTurn class to store only message indices and short previews instead of full message copies
   - Update _handle_jump_command method to use message indices for truncating the messages list
   - Update the code in start_chat that creates conversation turns to store indices instead of deep copies
   - Ensure all references to conversation_turns are updated to work with the new structure

2. UPDATE modules/chat/completers.py:
   - Update the JumpCompleter class to work with the new ConversationTurn structure
   - Ensure completions still show helpful message previews
