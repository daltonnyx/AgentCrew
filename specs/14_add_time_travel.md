 # Implement Jump Command for Interactive Chat

 > Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-level Tasks, and generate the code that will satisfy Objectives

 ## Objectives
 - Add a `/jump` command to the interactive chat that allows users to rewind the conversation to a previous turn
 - Implement a completer for the `/jump` command that shows available turns with message previews
 - Track conversation turns during the current session (no persistence required)
 - Provide clear feedback when jumping to a previous point in the conversation

 ## Contexts
 - modules/chat/interactive.py: Contains the InteractiveChat class that manages the chat interface
 - modules/chat/completers.py: Contains the ChatCompleter class for command completion
 - modules/chat/constants.py: Contains color constants and other shared values

 ## Low-level Tasks
 1. UPDATE modules/chat/interactive.py:
    - Add a ConversationTurn class to represent a single turn in the conversation
    - Modify InteractiveChat.__init__ to initialize a conversation_turns list
    - Add _handle_jump_command method to process the /jump command
    - Update start_chat method to store conversation turns after each assistant response
    - Update _process_user_input to handle the /jump command
    - Update _print_welcome_message to include information about the /jump command

 2. UPDATE modules/chat/completers.py:
    - Add a JumpCompleter class that provides completions for the /jump command
    - Update ChatCompleter to handle /jump command completions
    - Modify ChatCompleter.__init__ to accept conversation_turns parameter
