# Agent Class Enhancements for Tool Management

> Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-level Tasks, and generate the code that will satisfy Objectives

## Objectives
- Enhance the Agent base class to support deferred tool registration
- Implement tool definition storage in the Agent class
- Create methods for agent activation and deactivation
- Support proper tool lifecycle management when switching LLM services

## Contexts
- modules/agents/base.py: Contains the Agent base class
- modules/llm/base.py: Contains the BaseLLMService class
- modules/tools/registry.py: Contains the current ToolRegistry implementation

## Low-level Tasks
1. UPDATE modules/agents/base.py:
   - Modify Agent.__init__ to track tool registration status
   - Add methods for storing tool definitions without immediate LLM registration
   - Implement _extract_tool_name method for identifying tools
   - Create activate and deactivate methods for tool lifecycle management
   - Update register_tools_with_llm to handle deferred tool registration
   - Enhance clear_tools_from_llm to track registration status
   - Add update_llm_service method to handle LLM switching
