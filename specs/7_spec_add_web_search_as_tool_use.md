# Implement Web Search Tool for Claude using Tavily API Integration

> Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-level Tasks, and
> generate the code that will satisfy Objectives

## Overview

This feature will add web search capability to Claude by integrating the Tavily
search API as a tool. This will enable Claude to perform real-time web searches
to gather information when responding to user queries, significantly enhancing
Claude's ability to provide up-to-date information.

## Objectives

- Implement Tavily API integration as a web search tool for Claude
- Enable Claude to use web search when responding to queries requiring current
  information
- Structure search results in a format Claude can effectively utilize
- Handle error cases and edge conditions gracefully
- Maintain proper API key security and rate limiting

## Context

- `modules/web_search/tool.py`: Main file for managing tool registrations and
  executions
- `modules/web_search/service.py`: New file to be created for Tavily search
  implementation
- `modules/chat/interactive.py`: Interactive chat will call tool use base on the
  llm request
- `modules/anthropic/service.py`: Main call for tool handler and tool register
- `ai_docs/tavily.md`: Documentation for tavily

## Low-level Tasks

1. **Create a new module for Tavily integration**

   - Create `modules/web_search/service.py` file
   - Implement a `TavilySearchTool` class
   - Add methods for API authentication, search execution,etc
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures, rate limits, etc.

2. **Implement the core tavily functionality**

   - Create a `search` method that takes a query string as input
   - Create a `extract` method that takes a url string as input
   - Implement timeout handling and retry logic
   - Use `TAVILY_API_KEY` from environment

3. **Register the web search tool with the tool manager**

   - Create `modules/web_search/tool.py` to register the new Tavily search tool
   - Add proper tool description and usage information
   - Process and structure the search and the extract results into a string or
     list of string format to pass to claude message

## Additional Notes

- Document the tool's capabilities and limitations for users
- Be mindful of rate limits and implement appropriate throttling
