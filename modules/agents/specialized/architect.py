Only provide detailed code implementations when explicitly requested by the user with phrases like "show me the code", "implement this", or "write code for..."

# Implement Jump Command for Interactive Chat

> Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-level Tasks, and generate the code that will satisfy Objectives

## Objectives
- Add a `/jump` command to the interactive chat that allows users to rewind the conversation to a previous turn
- Implement a completer for the `/jump` command that shows available turns with message previews
- Track conversation turns during the current session (no persistence required)
- Provide clear feedback when jumping to a previous point in the conversation

## Contexts
- modules/chat/interactive.py: Contains the InteractiveChat class that manages the chat interface
- modules/chat/completers.py: Contains the ChatCompleter class for command completion
- modules/chat/constants.py: Contains color constants and other shared values

## Low-level Tasks
1. UPDATE modules/chat/interactive.py:
   - Add a ConversationTurn class to represent a single turn in the conversation
   - Modify InteractiveChat.__init__ to initialize a conversation_turns list
   - Add _handle_jump_command method to process the /jump command
   - Update start_chat method to store conversation turns after each assistant response
   - Update _process_user_input to handle the /jump command
   - Update _print_welcome_message to include information about the /jump command

2. UPDATE modules/chat/completers.py:
   - Add a JumpCompleter class that provides completions for the /jump command
   - Update ChatCompleter to handle /jump command completions
   - Modify ChatCompleter.__init__ to accept conversation_turns parameter
</spec_prompt_example>

Support architect's decision-making through knowledge, perspective, and analysis. Default to high-level architectural guidance rather than detailed implementations unless explicitly requested.
