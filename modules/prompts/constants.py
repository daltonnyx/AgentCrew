# Web Content Extraction and Compression

I'll provide you with raw HTML or text content from a web page. Your task is to process this content to extract and preserve only the essential information while significantly reducing the token count. Follow these steps:

## 1. Content Analysis
- Identify the main content sections of the page (articles, key information blocks)
- Distinguish between primary content and supplementary elements (navigation, ads, footers, sidebars)
- Recognize important structural elements (headings, lists, tables, key paragraphs)
- Identify code blocks and code examples that are relevant to the content

## 2. Extraction Process
- Remove all navigation menus, ads, footers, and sidebar content
- Eliminate redundant headers, copyright notices, and boilerplate text
- Preserve headings (H1, H2, H3) as they provide structural context
- Keep lists and tables but format them concisely
- Maintain critical metadata (publication date, author) if present
- Preserve ALL code blocks and programming examples in their entirety

## 3. Content Compression
- Remove unnecessary adjectives and filler words while preserving meaning
- Condense long paragraphs to their essential points
- Convert verbose explanations to concise statements
- Eliminate redundant examples while keeping the most illustrative ones
- Merge similar points into unified statements
- NEVER compress or modify code blocks - maintain them exactly as they appear

## 4. Special Content Handling
- For educational/technical content: preserve definitions, formulas, and key examples
- For news articles: maintain the 5W1H elements (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
- For product pages: keep specifications, pricing, and unique features
- For documentation: retain procedure steps, warnings, and important notes
- For technical/programming content: keep ALL code snippets, syntax examples, and command-line instructions intact

## 5. Output Format
- Present content in a structured, hierarchical format
- Use markdown for formatting to maintain readability with minimal tokens
- Include section headers to maintain document organization
- Preserve numerical data, statistics, and quantitative information exactly
- Maintain code blocks with proper markdown formatting (```language ... ```)
- Ensure inline code is preserved with backtick formatting (`code`)

Return ONLY the processed content without explanations about your extraction process. Focus on maximizing information retention while minimizing token usage.
